                        <p><span>Synopsis:</span> Part graphic novel, part memoir, <i>Wake</i> is an 
                        imaginative tour-de-force that tells the story of women-led slave revolts and 
                        chronicles scholar Rebecca Hall's efforts to uncover the truth about these women
                        warriors who, until now, have been left off the historical record.</p>
                        <p>Women warriors planned and led slave revolts on slave ships during the Middle Passage
                            They fought their enslavers throughout the Americas. And then they were erased from
                            history.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>Wake</i> tells the story of Dr. Rebecca Hall, a historian, a granddaughter of slaves,
                        and a woman haunted by the legacy of slavery. The accepted history of slave revolts has always 
                        told her that enslaved women took a back seat. But Rebecca decides to look deeper, and her journey 
                        takes her through the old court records, slave ship captain's logs, crumbling correspondence, and 
                        even the forensic evidence from the bones of enslaved women from the "negro burying ground" 
                        uncovered in Manhattan. She finds women warriors everywhere.</p>
                        <p>Using in-depth archival research and a measured use of historical imagination, Rebecca constructs 
                            the likely pasts of Adono and Alele, women rebels who fought for freedom during the Middle Passage, 
                            as well as the stories of women who led slave revolts in Colonial New York. 
                            We also follow Rebecca's own story as the legacy of slavery shapes life, both during her time 
                            as a successful attorney and later as a historian seeking the past that haunts her.
                        </p>
                        <p>Illustrated beautifully in black and white, Wake will take its place alongside classics of the 
                            graphic novel genre, like Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis and Art Spiegelman's Maus. The story of 
                            both a personal and national legacy, it is a powerful reminder that while the past is gone, we still live in its wake.</p>
